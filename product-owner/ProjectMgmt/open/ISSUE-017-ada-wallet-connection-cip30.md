# ISSUE-017: ADA Wallet Connection via CIP-30

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-14
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** wallet, cip-30, cardano, connection, integration, sprint-1, sprint-ready
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (2025-07-14)
**Sprint Priority:** 5 (Enables wallet track)

## Description
Implement CIP-30 wallet connector integration using the **hybrid QR code linking approach** to enable secure connection between ADA wallets and linked Veridian accounts. This provides the foundation for wallet balance verification through account linkage rather than direct wallet access.

**ðŸ”§ Updated based on ISSUE-001 research**: Wallet connection works through hybrid architecture where Veridian mobile app handles wallet operations, with Mendix coordinating through secure account linking.

- [ ] Implement CIP-30 wallet discovery and connection
- [ ] Add wallet provider compatibility layer
- [ ] Create wallet connection UI components
- [ ] Add wallet state management
- [ ] Implement wallet disconnection handling
