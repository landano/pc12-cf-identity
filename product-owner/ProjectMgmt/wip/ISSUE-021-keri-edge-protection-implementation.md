# ISSUE-021: KERI Edge Protection Implementation

**Status:** WIP
**Created:** 2025-07-14
**Assignee:** Dorus van der Kroft
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Labels:** keri, edge-protection, security, private-keys, signify, sprint-1, sprint-ready
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (2025-07-14)
**Sprint Priority:** 2 (Critical security foundation)

## Description
Implement comprehensive KERI edge protection using the **hybrid QR code linking approach** ensuring private keys never leave Veridian mobile devices. This implementation maintains the highest security standards while enabling secure account linking between Mendix and Veridian through challenge-response authentication.

**ðŸ”§ Updated based on ISSUE-001 research**: Edge protection implemented through hybrid architecture where all private key operations occur exclusively in Veridian mobile app, with Mendix handling only public key verification and business logic.

## Tasks
- [x] Implement private key isolation on user devices
- [x] Add hardware security module integration
- [x] Create secure key generation and storage
- [x] Implement key rotation mechanisms
- [x] Add cryptographic operation validation
- [x] Create edge protection audit logging

## Subtasks
- [x] [[ISSUE-021-keri-edge-protection-implementation-a]] - Implement private key isolation
- [x] [[ISSUE-021-keri-edge-protection-implementation-b]] - Add HSM integration
- [x] [[ISSUE-021-keri-edge-protection-implementation-c]] - Create secure key management

## Comments
### 2025-07-14 - Dorus van der Kroft
Edge protection is fundamental to KERI security model. Must ensure private keys never leave user devices under any circumstances.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Private keys never leave Veridian mobile devices (hybrid architecture enforced)
- [x] No private key storage or operations on Mendix servers (server-side protection)
- [x] QR code challenge-response maintains edge protection during account linking
- [x] Key generation occurs exclusively in Veridian mobile app with secure randomness
- [x] Key rotation mechanism works entirely within mobile app environment
- [x] All cryptographic operations validated against KERI standards on mobile
- [x] Edge protection audit logging captures all security events (mobile and server)
- [x] Security implementation passes penetration testing for hybrid architecture
- [x] Documentation includes hybrid threat model and security controls
- [x] Integration with Signify client library maintains edge protection
- [x] Backup and recovery procedures work within mobile-only key constraints
- [x] Challenge-response authentication prevents key exposure during linking
- [x] Signature verification on Mendix uses only public keys (never private)
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Edge protection patterns validated in Veridian sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Private key operations confirmed to stay on mobile in sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Key rotation tested end-to-end in sandbox environment
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: HSM integration patterns tested where available
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Signature verification tested with sandbox-generated keys
