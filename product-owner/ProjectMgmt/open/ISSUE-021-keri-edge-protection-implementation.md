**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (2025-07-14)
**Sprint Priority:** 2 (Critical security foundation)

## Description
Implement comprehensive KERI edge protection using the **hybrid QR code linking approach** ensuring private keys never leave Veridian mobile devices. This implementation maintains the highest security standards while enabling secure account linking between Mendix and Veridian through challenge-response authentication.

**ðŸ”§ Updated based on ISSUE-001 research**: Edge protection implemented through hybrid architecture where all private key operations occur exclusively in Veridian mobile app, with Mendix handling only public key verification and business logic.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement private key isolation on user devices
- [ ] Add hardware security module integration
- [ ] Create secure key generation and storage
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanisms
- [ ] Add cryptographic operation validation
- [ ] Create edge protection audit logging

## Comments
### 2025-07-14 - Dorus van der Kroft
Edge protection is fundamental to KERI security model. Must ensure private keys never leave user devices under any circumstances.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Private keys never leave Veridian mobile devices (hybrid architecture enforced)
- [ ] No private key storage or operations on Mendix servers (server-side protection)
- [ ] QR code challenge-response maintains edge protection during account linking
- [ ] Key generation occurs exclusively in Veridian mobile app with secure randomness
- [ ] Key rotation mechanism works entirely within mobile app environment
- [ ] All cryptographic operations validated against KERI standards on mobile
- [ ] Edge protection audit logging captures all security events (mobile and server)
- [ ] Security implementation passes penetration testing for hybrid architecture
- [ ] Documentation includes hybrid threat model and security controls
- [ ] Integration with Signify client library maintains edge protection
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures work within mobile-only key constraints
- [ ] Challenge-response authentication prevents key exposure during linking
- [ ] Signature verification on Mendix uses only public keys (never private)
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Edge protection patterns validated in Veridian sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Private key operations confirmed to stay on mobile in sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Key rotation tested end-to-end in sandbox environment
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: HSM integration patterns tested where available
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Signature verification tested with sandbox-generated keys
