# ISSUE-002: Chief Identity Creation UI

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-14
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** frontend, ui, chief, identity, keri

## Description
Create the Mendix user interface for village chiefs to create their digital identities as root-of-trust using the **hybrid QR code linking approach**. This interface facilitates identity creation in the Veridian mobile app while maintaining KERI edge protection (private keys never leave mobile device) and providing seamless integration with Mendix business logic.

**ðŸ”§ Updated based on ISSUE-001 research**: Implementation uses hybrid architecture where identity creation occurs in Veridian mobile app, with Mendix providing QR code challenges and account linking.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design QR code linking interface for chief identity creation
- [ ] Implement hybrid identity creation workflow (Mendix-Veridian)
- [ ] Add validation for identity data and QR code challenges
- [ ] Integrate with Veridian platform using challenge-response
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback for QR linking
- [ ] Create identity confirmation and account linking flow

## Subtasks
- [ ] [[ISSUE-002-chief-identity-creation-ui-a]] - Design form layout and validation rules
- [ ] [[ISSUE-002-chief-identity-creation-ui-b]] - Implement Mendix pages and microflows
- [ ] [[ISSUE-002-chief-identity-creation-ui-c]] - Integrate with Veridian KERIA APIs

- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for QR code scanning issues
- [ ] Account linking confirmation verifies successful identity creation
- [ ] Form supports required identity fields (name, role, jurisdiction) via QR data
- [ ] UI follows Mendix design standards and accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Identity creation generates valid AID in Veridian app (private keys stay on mobile)
- [ ] Success flow confirms account linkage and redirects to dashboard
- [ ] All QR linking interactions are logged for audit purposes
- [ ] KERI edge protection maintained (no private keys in Mendix)
- [ ] Challenge-response authentication validates identity ownership
