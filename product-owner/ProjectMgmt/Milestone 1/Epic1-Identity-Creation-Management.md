# Epic 1: Identity Creation and Management

## Overview
**User Value**: Village chiefs and representatives can create and manage their digital identities

## Functionality
- Chiefs can create root-of-trust identities
- Representatives can create their own identities
- Users can view and manage their identity information
- Basic identity validation and verification

## Acceptance Criteria
A village chief can successfully create their digital identity and a representative can create theirs, both visible and manageable within the Mendix application.

## Key User Stories
- As a village chief, I want to create my digital identity as a root of trust, so that I can issue credentials to my representatives
- As a representative, I want to create my digital identity, so that I can receive credentials from my chief
- As an identity holder, I want to view and manage my identity information, so that I can maintain accurate records
- As a system administrator, I want to validate identity creation, so that I can ensure proper security standards

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Chiefs can create root-of-trust identities through the Mendix interface
- [ ] Representatives can create their identities through the Mendix interface
- [ ] Identity information is properly stored and retrievable
- [ ] Basic identity validation is implemented
- [ ] User interface allows viewing and managing identity details
- [ ] Integration with Veridian platform for identity storage is functional

## Technical Considerations
- Integration with Veridian KERI protocol for identity creation
- Edge protection ensuring private keys never leave user devices
- Secure identity storage and retrieval mechanisms
- User interface design for identity management

## Dependencies
- Veridian platform integration research
- KERI protocol implementation decisions
- Mendix module architecture design

## Risks
- Complexity of KERI protocol integration
- Edge security implementation challenges
- User experience complexity for non-technical users
