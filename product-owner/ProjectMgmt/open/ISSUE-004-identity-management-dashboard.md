**Priority:** High
**Labels:** frontend, ui, dashboard, identity, management

## Description
Create a comprehensive dashboard for users to view and manage their digital identity information using the **hybrid QR code linking architecture**. The dashboard provides visibility into linked Veridian identities, account connections, and credential status while maintaining KERI edge protection (no private keys on Mendix servers).
