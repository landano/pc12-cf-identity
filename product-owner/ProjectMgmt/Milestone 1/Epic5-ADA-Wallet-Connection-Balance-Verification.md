# Epic 5: ADA Wallet Connection and Balance Verification

## Overview
**User Value**: Users can connect their ADA wallets to their Veridian Identity Wallets and verify wallet ownership and balance, enabling secure financial transactions within the Landano ecosystem.

## Functionality
- ADA wallet connection using CIP-30 standard
- Cryptographic challenge-response for wallet ownership verification
- Balance verification and validation
- Secure binding between ADA wallet and KERI AID
- Dual signature processes for enhanced security

## Acceptance Criteria
Users can successfully connect their ADA wallets to their Veridian Identity Wallets, prove ownership through cryptographic challenges, and verify wallet balances for secure transactions.

## Key User Stories
- As a user, I want to connect my ADA wallet to my Veridian Identity Wallet, so that I can prove my financial capabilities
- As a user, I want to verify my wallet balance, so that I can participate in land rights transactions
- As a verifier, I want to confirm that the ADA wallet belongs to the identity holder, so that I can trust financial transactions
- As a system, I want to create secure bindings between wallets and identities, so that I can prevent impersonation
- As a user, I want to sign challenges with both wallets simultaneously, so that I can prove dual ownership

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CIP-30 wallet connector integration is functional
- [ ] Cryptographic challenge generation and validation system is implemented
- [ ] Dual signature process (ADA wallet + Veridian wallet) is working
- [ ] Balance verification and validation mechanisms are in place
- [ ] Secure binding record creation and management is functional
- [ ] User interface for wallet connection and verification is complete
- [ ] Integration with existing Cardano Mendix plugin is seamless
- [ ] Error handling for wallet connection failures is implemented

## Technical Considerations
- CIP-30 wallet connector for ADA wallet integration
- Veridian SDK for identity wallet operations
- Secure challenge-response mechanism implementation
- Cryptographic signature verification algorithms
- Binding record storage and management system
- Cross-platform wallet compatibility

## Dependencies
- Cardano Mendix plugin integration
- Veridian Identity Wallet functionality
- CIP-30 standard compliance
- Cryptographic libraries for signature verification

## Risks
- Wallet compatibility issues across different providers
- Security vulnerabilities in dual signature processes
- User experience complexity for non-technical users
- Integration challenges with existing Cardano infrastructure
