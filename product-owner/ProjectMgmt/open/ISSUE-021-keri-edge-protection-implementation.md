## Description
Implement comprehensive KERI edge protection ensuring private keys never leave user devices and all cryptographic operations maintain the highest security standards required by KERI protocol.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement private key isolation on user devices
- [ ] Add hardware security module integration
- [ ] Create secure key generation and storage
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanisms
- [ ] Add cryptographic operation validation
- [ ] Create edge protection audit logging

## Comments
### 2025-07-14 - Dorus van der Kroft
Edge protection is fundamental to KERI security model. Must ensure private keys never leave user devices under any circumstances.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Private keys are never transmitted or stored outside user devices
- [ ] Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration is functional
- [ ] Key generation uses cryptographically secure random number generation
- [ ] Key rotation mechanism supports KERI protocol requirements
- [ ] All cryptographic operations are validated against KERI standards
- [ ] Edge protection audit logging captures all security events
- [ ] Security implementation passes penetration testing
- [ ] Documentation includes threat model and security controls
- [ ] Integration with Signify client library is complete
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures for keys are documented
