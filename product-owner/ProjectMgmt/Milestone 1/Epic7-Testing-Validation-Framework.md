# Epic 7: Testing and Validation Framework

## Overview
**User Value**: Developers and stakeholders can trust that the system works correctly and securely through comprehensive testing coverage and validation procedures.

## Functionality
- Unit testing framework with high code coverage
- Integration testing for end-to-end workflows
- Security testing including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- Performance testing and load testing
- Automated test execution and reporting
- Test data management and synthetic data generation
- Compliance testing for regulatory requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive testing framework is implemented with automated execution, achieving minimum 90% code coverage and validating all security, performance, and functional requirements.

## Key User Stories
- As a developer, I want automated unit tests, so that I can catch bugs early in development
- As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive integration tests, so that I can validate end-to-end workflows
- As a security engineer, I want security testing tools, so that I can identify and fix vulnerabilities
- As a product owner, I want test reports and metrics, so that I can make informed release decisions
- As a compliance officer, I want regulatory compliance testing, so that I can ensure legal requirements are met

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Unit testing framework (JUnit 5 with Mockito) is implemented
- [ ] Minimum 90% code coverage is achieved across all modules
- [ ] Integration testing suite covers all end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Security testing includes penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Performance and load testing framework is operational
- [ ] Test automation pipeline is integrated with CI/CD
- [ ] Test data management and synthetic data generation is functional
- [ ] Compliance testing validates regulatory requirements
- [ ] Test reporting and metrics dashboard is available
- [ ] Error handling and recovery testing is comprehensive
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing is complete
- [ ] User acceptance testing procedures are documented

## Technical Considerations
- JUnit 5 framework with Mockito for mocking
- Selenium or similar for UI automation testing
- Performance testing tools (JMeter, Gatling)
- Security testing tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite)
- Test data factories and builders
- Continuous integration pipeline integration
- Test environment management and containerization
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback

## Dependencies
- Development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure
- Test data and environment provisioning
- Security testing tools and licenses
- Performance testing infrastructure

## Risks
- Complex integration testing across multiple systems
- Performance testing environment limitations
- Security testing tool configuration complexity
- Test data privacy and security concerns
- Maintaining test coverage as system evolves
