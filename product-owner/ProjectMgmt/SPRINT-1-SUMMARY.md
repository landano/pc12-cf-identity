# Sprint 1 Summary - Foundation Sprint

**Sprint Period:** 2025-07-14 to 2025-07-28 (2 weeks)  
**Sprint Goal:** Establish core foundations for Veridian Identity integration and security architecture  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-15 - Prioritization review completed

## Sprint Objectives
Create the essential foundation layer that will unblock the maximum number of subsequent development tracks by implementing:
- Veridian platform integration specifications
- Core security architecture (KERI edge protection and transport security)
- Essential integration points (Cardano plugin and wallet connectivity)

## Selected Issues (5 total)

### 1. ISSUE-001: Veridian Platform Integration Research
**Sprint Priority:** 1 (Critical - Unblocks 12 issues)  
**Epic:** Identity Creation and Management  
**Impact:** Foundational research enabling all identity features  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete Veridian API analysis and documentation
- KERI protocol implementation requirements
- Mendix integration patterns with security specifications
- Technical integration specification ready for implementation

### 2. ISSUE-021: KERI Edge Protection Implementation  
**Sprint Priority:** 2 (CRITICAL - Updated to highest priority)  
**Epic:** Security Implementation and Cryptographic Protection  
**Impact:** Foundational security layer - blocks all identity creation features  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Private key isolation on user devices
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Secure key generation, storage, and rotation mechanisms
- Edge protection audit logging
**Note:** This must be completed before identity creation features can begin

### 3. ISSUE-022: Transport Security Implementation

**Epic:** Security Implementation and Cryptographic Protection  
**Impact:** Secures all communication channels  
**Key Deliverables:**
- TLS 1.3 implementation for all communications
- Certificate pinning for API endpoints
- Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
- Transport security monitoring and audit logging

### 4. ISSUE-015: Cardano Plugin Integration
**Sprint Priority:** 4 (Enables NFT track)  
**Epic:** NFT Ownership Verification  
**Impact:** Enables NFT management capabilities  
**Key Deliverables:**
- Analysis of existing Cardano plugin capabilities
- Secure integration architecture with security boundaries
- NFT querying and metadata access functionality
- Wallet interoperability features

### 5. ISSUE-017: ADA Wallet Connection via CIP-30
**Sprint Priority:** 5 (Enables wallet track)  
**Epic:** ADA Wallet Connection and Balance Verification  
**Impact:** Enables wallet connectivity for balance verification  
**Key Deliverables:**
- CIP-30 wallet discovery and connection
- Wallet provider compatibility layer
- Wallet connection UI components
- Wallet state management and switching capabilities

## Success Metrics
- All 5 issues moved from Open to Closed status
- All acceptance criteria met for each issue
- Security implementations pass initial security review
- Integration specifications enable dependent issue implementation
- No critical security vulnerabilities identified

## Risk Mitigation
- **Veridian API Changes:** Regular communication with Veridian team for API stability
- **Integration Complexity:** Phased implementation approach for complex integrations
- **Security Requirements:** Early security review and validation
- **Dependency Blocking:** Clear communication of completion status to dependent issues

## Sprint 1 Prioritization Update (2025-07-15)

**Current Status:** ISSUE-001 moved to WIP, research underway

**Updated Implementation Priority:**
1. Complete ISSUE-001 (already in progress)
2. ISSUE-021 (CRITICAL) - Must complete before any identity features
3. ISSUE-022 - Can be developed in parallel with ISSUE-021
4. ISSUE-015 & ISSUE-017 - Can proceed after security foundations

**Added Sprint-Ready Labels to:**
- ISSUE-002: Chief Identity Creation UI
- ISSUE-003: Representative Identity Creation UI
- ISSUE-005: Credential Issuance by Chief (also added acceptance criteria)

## Next Sprint Preparation
Upon completion of Sprint 1, the following high-priority issues will be ready:
- ISSUE-002: Chief Identity Creation UI (sprint-ready)
- ISSUE-003: Representative Identity Creation UI (sprint-ready)
- ISSUE-005: Credential Issuance by Chief (sprint-ready)
- ISSUE-004: Identity Management Dashboard
- ISSUE-013: NFT-KERI Identity Binding
- ISSUE-014: NFT Ownership Verification dApp
- ISSUE-018: Wallet Balance Verification
