## Description
Implement comprehensive transport layer security with TLS 1.3 for all communications, certificate pinning for API endpoints, and mutual TLS for service-to-service communication to ensure secure data transmission.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement TLS 1.3 for all communications
- [ ] Add certificate pinning for API endpoints
- [ ] Create mutual TLS for service communication
- [ ] Add transport security monitoring
- [ ] Implement certificate management
- [ ] Create transport security audit logging

Transport security is essential for protecting all communications. Must implement enterprise-grade TLS configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TLS 1.3 is implemented for all API communications
- [ ] Certificate pinning is configured for all external API endpoints
- [ ] Mutual TLS is implemented for service-to-service communication
- [ ] Transport security monitoring captures all security events
- [ ] Certificate management system handles rotation and renewal
- [ ] Security audit logging covers all transport layer activities
- [ ] Configuration follows industry security standards (OWASP, NIST)
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<5% latency increase)
- [ ] Error handling provides secure failure modes
- [ ] Documentation includes security configuration guide
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: TLS 1.3 connections tested with all sandbox URLs
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Certificate validation verified in sandbox environment
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Mutual TLS tested if supported by sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Secure communication patterns validated
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Error handling and recovery tested in sandbox
