# ISSUE-003: Representative Identity Creation UI

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-14
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** frontend, ui, representative, identity, signify

## Description
Create the Mendix user interface for representatives to create their digital identities using the **hybrid QR code linking approach** with Veridian Identity Wallet. This interface facilitates identity creation in the Veridian mobile app while maintaining KERI edge protection and providing seamless account linking with Mendix.

**ðŸ”§ Updated based on ISSUE-001 research**: Implementation uses hybrid architecture where identity creation occurs in Veridian mobile app via QR code challenge-response, ensuring private keys never leave mobile device.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design representative identity creation form
- [ ] Implement Signify integration for edge protection
- [ ] Add identity data validation
- [ ] Create connection flow with chief's identity
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test identity creation workflow

- [ ] QR code generation includes secure challenge and expires within 10 minutes
- [ ] Veridian mobile app integration ensures private keys never leave device
- [ ] Account linking flow successfully connects representative to chief identity
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for QR code and linking issues
- [ ] Form supports required fields (name, role, chief reference) via QR data
- [ ] UI follows Mendix design standards and accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Identity creation generates valid AID in Veridian app linked to chief's AID
- [ ] Hybrid architecture maintains KERI edge protection throughout
- [ ] Success flow confirms account linkage and navigates to dashboard
- [ ] Challenge-response authentication validates representative identity
- [ ] Connection to chief's AID is cryptographically verified
