# Epic 4: NFT Ownership Verification

## Overview
**User Value**: Land rights holders can prove they control both their NFT and their digital identity

## Functionality
- Link Cardano NFTs to KERI identities
- Verify ownership of specific Landano land rights NFTs
- Cryptographic proof of control over both systems
- Integration with existing Cardano wallet functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
A landowner can prove they control both their Landano land rights NFT and their corresponding digital identity, enabling secure land transactions.

## Key User Stories
- As a landowner, I want to link my Landano NFT to my digital identity, so that I can prove ownership in transactions
- As a verifier, I want to verify that someone controls both their NFT and digital identity, so that I can validate legitimate land ownership
- As a landowner, I want to use my existing Cardano wallet, so that I don't need to learn new wallet management
- As a system user, I want the NFT-identity binding to be tamper-evident, so that I can trust the ownership claims
- As an integrator, I want to leverage existing Cardano plugin functionality, so that we can build on proven infrastructure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] NFTs can be linked to KERI identities through cryptographic binding
- [ ] Ownership verification works for both NFT and identity
- [ ] Integration with existing Cardano Mendix plugin is functional
- [ ] Tamper-evident metadata binding is implemented
- [ ] User interface supports NFT-identity linking workflow
- [ ] Verification process validates both NFT ownership and identity control

## Technical Considerations
- Integration with existing Cardano Mendix plugin
- NFT metadata modification or extension for identity binding
- Cryptographic binding protocols between KERI and Cardano
- CIP-30 wallet integration for signing operations
- Cross-chain verification mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 (Identity Creation) must be completed
- Existing Cardano Mendix plugin functionality
- NFT metadata schema design
- Cross-chain cryptographic binding research

## Risks
- Complexity of cross-chain integration
- Performance of dual verification processes
- Compatibility with existing Cardano plugin
- User experience for cross-chain operations
- Security of cross-chain binding mechanisms
