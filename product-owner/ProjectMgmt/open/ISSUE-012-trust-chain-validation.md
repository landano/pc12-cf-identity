**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** trust-chain, validation, keri, cryptography, security

## Description
Implement comprehensive trust chain validation to ensure the integrity of the chief-to-representative authority relationship. This validates that representatives have legitimate authority from their chiefs.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design trust chain validation algorithm
- [ ] Implement cryptographic chain verification
- [ ] Add trust path discovery logic
- [ ] Create trust validation results display
- [ ] Add trust chain caching for performance
- [ ] Implement trust chain update mechanisms

## Subtasks
- [ ] [[ISSUE-012-trust-chain-validation-a]] - Design trust chain validation algorithm
- [ ] [[ISSUE-012-trust-chain-validation-b]] - Implement cryptographic chain verification
- [ ] [[ISSUE-012-trust-chain-validation-c]] - Add trust path discovery logic
- [ ] [[ISSUE-012-trust-chain-validation-d]] - Create performance optimization with caching
