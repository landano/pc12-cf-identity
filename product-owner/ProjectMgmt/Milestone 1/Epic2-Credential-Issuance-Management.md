# Epic 2: Credential Issuance and Management

## Overview
**User Value**: Chiefs can issue credentials to representatives, and both can manage their credentials

## Functionality
- Chiefs can issue representative credentials to their delegates
- Representatives can view and manage received credentials
- Credential status tracking (active, revoked, expired)
- Credential metadata and claims management

## Acceptance Criteria
A village chief can issue a "representative authority" credential to their delegate, and the representative can view and manage this credential in their dashboard.

## Key User Stories
- As a village chief, I want to issue representative credentials to my delegates, so that they can act on my behalf for land transactions
- As a representative, I want to receive and view credentials from my chief, so that I can prove my authority
- As a credential holder, I want to manage my credentials (view status, metadata), so that I can maintain my authorization records
- As a credential issuer, I want to revoke credentials when necessary, so that I can manage access control
- As a verifier, I want to check credential status, so that I can validate current authorization

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Chiefs can issue credentials through the Mendix interface
- [ ] Representatives can view received credentials in their dashboard
- [ ] Credential status is properly tracked and displayed
- [ ] Credential revocation functionality is implemented
- [ ] Credential metadata and claims are properly stored and displayed
- [ ] Integration with ACDC credential format is functional

## Technical Considerations
- ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) credential implementation
- Credential schema design and validation
- Secure credential issuance and storage
- Credential lifecycle management (issuance, renewal, revocation)

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 (Identity Creation) must be completed
- ACDC credential format integration
- Veridian credential management infrastructure

## Risks
- Credential format complexity
- Credential verification performance
- Scalability of credential storage and retrieval
