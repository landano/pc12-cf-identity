## Description
Research and document the integration approach for the Veridian platform within the Mendix architecture. This foundational work will inform all subsequent identity management features and ensure proper KERI protocol compliance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research Veridian API documentation and capabilities
- [ ] Document KERI protocol implementation requirements
- [ ] Identify integration points with Mendix platform
- [ ] Create technical integration specification
- [ ] Validate edge protection requirements
- [ ] Document security considerations for private key management

## Subtasks
- [ ] [[ISSUE-001-veridian-platform-integration-research-a]] - Study Veridian API documentation
- [ ] [[ISSUE-001-veridian-platform-integration-research-b]] - Analyze KERI protocol requirements
- [ ] [[ISSUE-001-veridian-platform-integration-research-c]] - Design Mendix integration patterns
- [ ] [[ISSUE-001-veridian-platform-integration-research-d]] - Define security architecture

## Related Issues
- Implements: Epic 1 - Identity Creation and Management
- Blocks: [[ISSUE-002-chief-identity-creation-ui]]
- Blocks: [[ISSUE-003-representative-identity-creation-ui]]

## Relationships
- Depends on: Veridian platform documentation availability
- Blocks: All identity creation features
- Implements: [[Epic1-Identity-Creation-Management]]

## Comments
### 2025-07-14 - Dorus van der Kroft
Created as foundational research issue for Epic 1. This must be completed before any identity creation features can be implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Veridian API documentation is thoroughly analyzed and documented
- [ ] KERI protocol implementation requirements are clearly defined
- [ ] Mendix integration patterns are documented with code examples
- [ ] Security architecture includes private key protection specification
- [ ] Technical integration specification is complete and reviewed
- [ ] Edge protection requirements are validated against KERI standards
- [ ] Documentation includes API endpoints, authentication methods, and data formats
- [ ] Integration patterns cover both KERIA (cloud agent) and Signify (client-side) components
