## Description
Implement the core credential verification functionality that allows verifiers to request and validate credential presentations from representatives. This is critical for the land transaction approval process.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design verification request workflow
- [ ] Implement cryptographic signature verification
- [ ] Add trust chain validation logic
- [ ] Create verification result display
- [ ] Add verification audit logging
- [ ] Implement verification API endpoints
