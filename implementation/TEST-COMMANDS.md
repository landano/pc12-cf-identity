# Command Testing and Validation

This document provides testing procedures and validation for all team member commands to ensure they work correctly with the project management system.

## Validation Test Results

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Sprint Information**: All sprint-ready issues should be identified correctly
2. **Issue Management**: Issues should be movable between states with proper git commits
3. **Security Validation**: Security requirements should be detected and validated
4. **Documentation Access**: All project documentation should be accessible
5. **Workflow Integration**: Git operations should work correctly with ProjectMgmt

### Command Integration Test
```bash
# Full integration test simulation
echo "=== FULL INTEGRATION TEST ==="

# Simulate starting work on an issue (dry run)
echo "Simulating issue workflow..."
test_issue="ISSUE-001"
echo "1. Would move $test_issue from open to wip"
echo "2. Would update status to WIP"
echo "3. Would assign to current user"
echo "4. Would add start comment"
echo "5. Would commit with git"

# Simulate progress update (dry run)
echo "Simulating progress update..."
echo "1. Would add implementation log entry"
echo "2. Would update task checkboxes"
echo "3. Would commit progress"

# Simulate completion (dry run)
echo "Simulating issue completion..."
echo "1. Would check acceptance criteria"
echo "2. Would move to closed directory"
echo "3. Would update status to Closed"
echo "4. Would commit completion"
echo "5. Would identify unblocked issues"

echo "✓ Integration test simulation completed"
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Git User Not Configured**: Run `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
2. **Permission Denied**: Ensure proper file permissions for ProjectMgmt directory
3. **Missing Issue Files**: Check that issues exist in expected directories
4. **Git Commit Failures**: Verify git repository is properly initialized

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Quick validation of entire setup
echo "=== QUICK VALIDATION ==="
echo "Git user: $(git config --global user.name)"
echo "Sprint file: $([ -f "../product-owner/ProjectMgmt/SPRINT-1-SUMMARY.md" ] && echo "✓" || echo "✗")"
echo "Open issues: $(ls ../product-owner/ProjectMgmt/open/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Sprint-ready: $(grep -r "sprint-ready" ../product-owner/ProjectMgmt/open/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Commands file: $([ -f "./commands" ] && echo "✓" || echo "✗")"
echo "Guide file: $([ -f "./HowToImplementThisProject.md" ] && echo "✓" || echo "✗")"
```
