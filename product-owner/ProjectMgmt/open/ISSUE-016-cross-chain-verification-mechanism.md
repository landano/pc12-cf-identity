# ISSUE-016: Cross-Chain Verification Mechanism

**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-07-14
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** cross-chain, verification, cardano, keri, cryptography

## Description
Implement the cross-chain verification mechanism that validates ownership and control across both Cardano blockchain (for NFTs) and KERI identity systems. This ensures secure and tamper-evident verification of dual ownership.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design cross-chain verification protocol
- [ ] Implement dual-signature validation
- [ ] Add cross-chain proof generation
- [ ] Create verification result aggregation
- [ ] Add cross-chain verification caching
- [ ] Implement verification status tracking
