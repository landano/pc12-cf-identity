[GENERAL] Will your project’s output/s be fully open source?
Yes
[GENERAL] Please provide here more information on the open source status of your project outputs
The Landano project will issue an Apache 2.0 license for the intellectual works it creates, including the Mendix design models used to operate the Landano Mendix infrastructure, along with any software artifacts that are produced as a result. Note that some of the Landano components will have a dependency on Mendix’s public cloud infrastructure to execute some compute tasks. However, releasing the Landano models under Apache 2.0 license makes it easy for anyone to permissionlessly inspect, modify, and enhance these components and run them as their own modified Mendix modules, whether for personal or commercial use.

[SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution
In the past year there has been overwhelming interest in the use of blockchains like Cardano for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Many Cardano projects, like Landano, are early leaders in this RealFi space. A critical component that many Cardano projects have been struggling with is a reliable and comprehensive decentralized identifier (DID) tool and protocol. This is critical to speed up implementation and market-share capture. There have been a number of tools and protocols developed over the past two years but the Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet initiative looks to have the most impact going forward. This is bolstered by its adoption of the KERI protocol which the Landano project, amongst many others, is looking to implement. See https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri 

Landano is developed using the Mendix development architecture. See https://docs.landano.io/d/technical-architecture. The Landano project will create a wrapper around the Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet as a Mendix plugin that can be used by other Cardano and Mendix projects. We will deliver and demonstrate the following core ID wallet use cases using the KERI protocol and CF ID wallet:

Verify user identity
Verify user ownership of NFT
Landano use cases will also involve transaction fees and commissions that will require the movement of ADA and possibly other currencies. The Landano wrapper will prototype the integration of Cardano Foundation ID wallet records with ADA balances held in a standard cryptocurrency wallet. 

[IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community
Many Cardano projects have been struggling with adopting a reliable and comprehensive decentralized identifier (DID) tool and protocol. This is critical to speed up implementation and market-share capture. Our project will demonstrate a practical real-world implementation of the Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet and the KERI protocol. Landano will share the deliverables of this project as Mendix plugins to allow other Cardano and Mendix developers to speed up their own decentralized identifier (DID) solutions. This will attract many other RWA projects to Cardano as they realize that choosing the right open DID platform and protocol is critical for RealFi success.

[VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?
The Mendix plug-in for Cardano is already under development, and will be completed by Q4 2024. Low-code adaptations like this have great potential to expand access for development and use for the Cardano ecosystem. Adding DID functionality to this expanded accessibility creates obvious potential for widespread adoption by adding a crucial element for many blockchain use cases, and will also increase Cardano’s utility for such use cases that demand secure and confident identity verification.
