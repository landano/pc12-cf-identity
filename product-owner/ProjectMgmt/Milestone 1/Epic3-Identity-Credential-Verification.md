# Epic 3: Identity and Credential Verification

## Overview
**User Value**: Third parties can verify someone's identity and credentials for land transactions

## Functionality
- Verifiers can request credential presentations
- Representatives can present their credentials for verification
- Verification results are recorded and auditable
- Trust chain validation from chief to representative

## Acceptance Criteria
A land transaction verifier can validate that a representative has legitimate authority from their chief to approve land transactions.

## Key User Stories
- As a verifier, I want to request credential presentations from representatives, so that I can validate their authority
- As a representative, I want to present my credentials to verifiers, so that I can prove my authorization
- As a verifier, I want to see verification results and audit trails, so that I can make informed decisions about land transactions
- As a system auditor, I want to review verification history, so that I can ensure proper governance
- As a verifier, I want to validate the entire trust chain (chief â†’ representative), so that I can ensure legitimate authority

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Verifiers can request credential presentations through the interface
- [ ] Representatives can respond to verification requests
- [ ] Verification results are properly calculated and displayed
- [ ] Trust chain validation is implemented and functional
- [ ] Verification audit trail is maintained
- [ ] Integration with KERI verification protocols is functional

## Technical Considerations
- Cryptographic signature verification
- Trust chain validation algorithms
- Verification request/response protocols
- Audit trail storage and retrieval
- Performance optimization for verification operations

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 (Identity Creation) must be completed
- Epic 2 (Credential Issuance) must be completed
- KERI verification protocol integration
- Cryptographic verification libraries

## Risks
- Verification performance at scale
- Complex trust chain validation logic
- User experience for verification workflows
- Security of verification processes
