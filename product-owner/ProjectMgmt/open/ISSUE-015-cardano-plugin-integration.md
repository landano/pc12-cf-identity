Must leverage existing Cardano plugin while maintaining strict security boundaries. Integration should enhance rather than complicate existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing Cardano plugin capabilities are thoroughly analyzed and documented
- [ ] Integration architecture maintains strict security boundaries
- [ ] NFT querying functionality is integrated without compromising security
- [ ] Wallet interoperability features work seamlessly with existing plugin
- [ ] Isolated execution contexts prevent security leaks between systems
- [ ] Integration testing validates compatibility with existing functionality
- [ ] Security review confirms no privilege escalation risks
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal on existing Cardano operations
- [ ] Error handling maintains security boundaries in failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation covers integration patterns and security considerations
