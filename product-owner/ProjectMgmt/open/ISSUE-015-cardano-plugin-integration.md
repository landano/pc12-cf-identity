## Description
Integrate with the existing Cardano Mendix plugin to leverage proven NFT management capabilities while maintaining security boundaries between KERI identity operations and Cardano blockchain operations.

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze existing Cardano plugin capabilities
- [ ] Design integration architecture with security boundaries
- [ ] Implement NFT querying and metadata access
- [ ] Add wallet interoperability features
- [ ] Create isolated execution contexts for security
- [ ] Test integration with existing functionality

## Subtasks
- [ ] [[ISSUE-015-cardano-plugin-integration-a]] - Analyze existing plugin architecture
- [ ] [[ISSUE-015-cardano-plugin-integration-b]] - Design secure integration patterns
- [ ] [[ISSUE-015-cardano-plugin-integration-c]] - Implement NFT operations integration
- [ ] [[ISSUE-015-cardano-plugin-integration-d]] - Add wallet interoperability features

## Comments
### 2025-07-14 - Dorus van der Kroft
Must leverage existing Cardano plugin while maintaining strict security boundaries. Integration should enhance rather than complicate existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing Cardano plugin capabilities are thoroughly analyzed and documented
- [ ] Integration architecture maintains strict security boundaries with hybrid approach
- [ ] NFT querying functionality works with linked Veridian accounts (no direct wallet access)
- [ ] Wallet interoperability features integrate through account linking (not direct connection)
- [ ] Isolated execution contexts prevent security leaks between Mendix and Veridian systems
- [ ] Integration testing validates compatibility with hybrid QR linking approach
- [ ] Security review confirms no privilege escalation risks in hybrid architecture
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal on existing Cardano operations
- [ ] Error handling maintains security boundaries in failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation covers hybrid integration patterns and security considerations
- [ ] NFT metadata extraction works through linked account relationships
- [ ] KERI AID binding to NFTs verified through account linkage validation
