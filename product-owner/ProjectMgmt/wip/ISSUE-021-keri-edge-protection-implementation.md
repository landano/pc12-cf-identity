# ISSUE-021: KERI Edge Protection Implementation

**Status:** WIP
**Created:** 2025-07-14
**Assignee:** Dorus van der Kroft
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Labels:** keri, edge-protection, security, private-keys, signify, sprint-1, sprint-ready
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (2025-07-14)
**Sprint Priority:** 2 (Critical security foundation)

## Description
Implement comprehensive KERI edge protection using the **hybrid QR code linking approach** ensuring private keys never leave Veridian mobile devices. This implementation maintains the highest security standards while enabling secure account linking between Mendix and Veridian through challenge-response authentication.

**üîß Updated based on ISSUE-001 research**: Edge protection implemented through hybrid architecture where all private key operations occur exclusively in Veridian mobile app, with Mendix handling only public key verification and business logic.

## Comments

Edge protection is fundamental to KERI security model. Must ensure private keys never leave user devices under any circumstances.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Private keys never leave Veridian mobile devices (hybrid architecture enforced) - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] No private key storage or operations on Mendix servers (server-side protection) - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] QR code challenge-response maintains edge protection during account linking - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Key generation occurs exclusively in Veridian mobile app with secure randomness - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Key rotation mechanism works entirely within mobile app environment - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] All cryptographic operations validated against KERI standards on mobile - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Edge protection audit logging captures all security events (mobile and server) - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Security implementation passes penetration testing for hybrid architecture - **DESIGNED**
- [x] Documentation includes hybrid threat model and security controls - **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Integration with Signify client library maintains edge protection - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures work within mobile-only key constraints - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Challenge-response authentication prevents key exposure during linking - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] Signature verification on Mendix uses only public keys (never private) - **DESIGNED**
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Edge protection patterns validated in Veridian sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Private key operations confirmed to stay on mobile in sandbox
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Key rotation tested end-to-end in sandbox environment
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: HSM integration patterns tested where available
- [ ] **Sandbox Testing**: Signature verification tested with sandbox-generated keys

### 2025-07-14 20:00 - Dorus van der Kroft IMPLEMENTATION STATUS CORRECTION
**Action**: Corrected implementation status - architectural designs completed but no working code implemented
**Status**: Moved acceptance criteria from "completed" to "designed" to reflect actual work done
**Reality Check**: Created comprehensive documentation and specifications, but no functional code exists

**What Was Actually Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Design**: Complete hybrid QR code linking architecture
- ‚úÖ **Technical Specifications**: Detailed implementation patterns and security controls
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive threat model and security framework
- ‚úÖ **API Designs**: REST endpoint specifications and integration patterns

**What Still Needs Implementation**:
- ‚ùå **Functional Code**: No working Java services, REST endpoints, or microflows
- ‚ùå **Mendix Project**: No Mendix module or application structure created
- ‚ùå **Database Schema**: No actual database entities or tables implemented
- ‚ùå **Test Framework**: No executable tests or validation procedures

**Analysis of Veridian.id Implementation**:
- **Available**: ~70% of core identity infrastructure (KERIA, Signify, mobile app)
- **Needed**: ~30% custom integration and business logic for Mendix
- **Gap**: Mendix-specific integration components, QR linking system, NFT verification

**Critical Finding**: **Mendix Project and Specialist Required**
- Need dedicated Mendix module for Veridian integration
- Require custom Java actions for KERI protocol operations
- Need REST API layer for mobile app callbacks
- Recommend involving Mendix specialist for implementation

**Next Steps**: Issue needs to be escalated to Product Owner for Mendix project setup and resource allocation.
