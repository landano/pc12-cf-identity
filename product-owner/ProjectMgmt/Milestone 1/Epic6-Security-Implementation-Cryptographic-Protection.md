# Epic 6: Security Implementation and Cryptographic Protection

## Overview
**User Value**: Users can trust that their identities and credentials are protected by enterprise-grade security measures, ensuring private keys never leave their devices and all operations maintain the highest security standards.

## Functionality
- KERI edge protection implementation
- Private key isolation and hardware security module integration
- Transport layer security (TLS 1.3) for all communications
- Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure key management and rotation policies
- Threat detection and mitigation systems

## Acceptance Criteria
The system implements comprehensive security measures that protect user identities, credentials, and private keys according to KERI protocol requirements and enterprise security standards.

## Key User Stories
- As a user, I want my private keys to never leave my device, so that I can maintain complete control over my identity
- As a system administrator, I want comprehensive security monitoring, so that I can detect and respond to threats
- As a developer, I want secure APIs and communication channels, so that I can build trusted applications
- As a compliance officer, I want security audit trails, so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance
- As a user, I want automatic key rotation, so that I can maintain long-term security without manual intervention

## Definition of Done
- [ ] KERI edge protection is fully implemented with private key isolation
- [ ] Hardware security module (HSM) integration is functional
- [ ] TLS 1.3 encryption is implemented for all communications
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication system is operational
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented
- [ ] Encryption at rest (AES-256) is configured for all sensitive data
- [ ] Automated key rotation policies are in place
- [ ] Security monitoring and alerting system is active
- [ ] Threat detection and mitigation procedures are implemented
- [ ] Security audit logging is comprehensive and compliant
- [ ] Penetration testing has been conducted and vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Security documentation and procedures are complete

## Technical Considerations
- EdDSA with Ed25519 curves for digital signatures
- SHA-256 hash functions for integrity verification
- Hardware entropy sources for secure key generation
- Certificate pinning for API endpoints
- Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect integration
- Input validation and sanitization frameworks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) and CSRF protection

## Dependencies
- KERI protocol compliance requirements
- Hardware security module availability
- Cryptographic library integrations
- Security monitoring infrastructure
- Audit logging systems

## Risks
- Complexity of implementing KERI edge protection
- Hardware security module integration challenges
- Performance impact of comprehensive security measures
- Compliance with evolving security standards
- User experience impact of security requirements
